# Imperium
Imperium Full Game

## Overview

Imperium is a historical grand strategy game written in Java for Android devices.
It is inspired by similar board games, such as [*RISK*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)), and by video games like [*Europe Universalis IV*](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/europa-universalis-iv/about).  I consider it
a well-rounded example of my skills with Android and Java.

## Java and Android

Imperium utilizes many of the features Java nad Android have to offer.
These include:

- Permissions management
- Assets - Text and images bundled inside the app file to be utilized during execution.
- Audio management
- Bitmap manipulation
- Android in-app purchase features (deprecated)
- Shared preferences

## Game Play

The game play of Imperium is broken up into turns for each player, where
each turn is broken up into three phases:

- Reinforce - When a player places newly earned units into the game
- Attack - When a player is able to attack enemy units in adjacent provinces
- Movement - When a player can move their surviving units across friendly territory.

The objective of the game is to eliminate all other players from the game by
defeating all of their units and claiming all of their territory.
